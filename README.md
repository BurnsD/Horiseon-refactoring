# Horiseon-refactoring

## Refactoring a marketing web site to use semantic tags

In this project I am taking a existing marketing web site and refactoring it to us semantic tags.

I added a title to the page changing it from "website" to "Horiseon"

I have refactored all the element tags within the main body of content to a generic element tag of "MB-content" so that all tags can be adjusted with the same tag

I have refactored all the element tags within the benefit section to tags of "benefit-txt" and "benefit-img" respectfully so the text and images can be adjusted within the same tag

I have refactored the CSS to mimic the new tags and delete the redundancies that were present. 

I have added alt tags to each image and icon 

I have adjusted the HTML file to use semantic tags within the header along with using sections instead of divs within the main body of content and benefits

I fixed the id tags within the nav making the links usable
